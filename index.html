            <p>Basically when you shoot a basketball shot, traditionally, your going to flcik your wrist in some way when releasing the ball. why do players or anyone for that matter do that? they do it to put back spin on the ball itself. Now why would anyone want backspin on the ball? Short answer, is too have arc on the ball and havinda rc on the ball is better for your shot than no arc because when you shoot with arc there is a higher chance of the ball going in the hoop, because theres a a larger margin of space for it to fit into.</p>
